Shell Eco-marathon is a competition for High School and University Student Teams around the world providing a collaborative platform to get hands-on experience in achieving ultra-energy-efficiency. There are Challenger Events for first-time teams, and Regional Events for qualified teams.

Around the world the programme inspires thousands of students to work collaboratively to put their theories of energy-efficiency to the test, using cutting-edge technology, critical thinking, and innovative ideas.

There are two vehicle classes teams can choose to design:

UrbanConcept: vehicles that have familiar road car features (always 4 wheels)
Prototype: ultra-efficient, lightweight vehicles (generally 3 wheels)
They can then choose the engine, determining the energy category:

1. Internal Combustion Engine (gasoline, diesel, ethanol)
2. Battery-Electric
3. Hydrogen Fuel Cell

There are two global competitions within Shell Eco-marathon.

* Shell Eco-marathon Mileage Challenge:

Teams compete with student-built vehicles to see who can complete a valid track route using the least amount of energy. There are two vehicle classes: Prototype and UrbanConcept. Each vehicle class has designated time slots to compete on the track.

* Shell Eco-marathon Driversâ€™ World Championship:

The most energy-efficient UrbanConcept vehicles return to the track for a race. This time, each vehicle is given an allotted amount of energy and must be the first car to cross the finish line, without running out of energy!

In addition, The Autonomous Category will run in certain locations in 2019. This matches the efficiency of the UrbanConcept cars, with the application of cutting-edge technology that will allow it to successfully complete challenges without the need of a driver.
